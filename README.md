Init_Data
This is a data repository that support the findings in the paper "Electrochemically Modulated Separation of Olefin-Paraffin Gas Mixtures in Membrane Electrode Assemblies"
On matlab, run the script "Graph_Results_Summary_v01" to plot all relevant graphs that are shown in the main manuscript. 
Further details including Gas Chromatographs of all experimental recordings can be found in individual numbered data folder.
To find the appropriate data folder, refer to the excel spreadsheet "Result_Summary" which contains tables of summary data. Each column is labeled by the data folder number to which it pertains to.
In each data folder, it contains all appropriate raw chromatograph data from the MIcro GC 990 as ASCII file in "Compiled_Data" folder.
Matlab codes used to analyze the gas chromatographs and chronoamperometry data are also included in each numbered data folder.
Raw Chronoamperometry data (as text file) from the Potentiostat is included in each numbered data folder.
Matlab codes used to quantify the deconvoluted propylene concentration behavior is included in each numbered data folder.
